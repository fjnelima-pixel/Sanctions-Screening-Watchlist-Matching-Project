### Project Title

Name Screening & Sanctions Watchlist Matching

### Project Scenario 

A bank must screen customers and counterparties against sanctions and watchlists to identify potential matches and escalate high-risk cases.

### Case Summary

During routine sanctions screening, customer names were matched against a sanctions watchlist using fuzzy-matching techniques. 
Several potential matches exceeded the predefined similarity threshold and were escalated for analyst review.

### Analyst Assessment

High similarity scores suggest possible true matches requiring enhanced due diligence.
Medium-risk matches may represent false positives and should undergo secondary verification using additional identifiers such as date of birth, nationality and identification documents.

### Action Taken

High-risk matches recommended for immediate escalation

Medium-risk matches retained for further review

Continuous screening advised
